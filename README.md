# sales-cloud-with-paas-samples
Official Oracle samples created to support developers using Oracle PaaS with Traditional accounts to integrate with and extend the capabilities of Oracle Sales Cloud. Security is a primary focus for most of these samples. Developers can use these samples and the related documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/ to build their own similar implementations.

The readme provided with each sample provides a functional and technical overview and summarizes the primary and secondary patterns illustrated in the code and documentation. Instructions are provided to install, configure, and uninstall.

Documentation that supports developers in the process of building applications using similar patterns is found on the Solutions page in the Oracle Help Center (https://docs.oracle.com/en/solutions/). A link to the associated page is found at the bottom of each readme.
