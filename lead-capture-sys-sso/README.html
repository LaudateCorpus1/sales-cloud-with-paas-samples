<p>#README for Oracle Cloud -- SaaS for PaaS Sample</p>
<h2>Sample Name</h2>
<p>Lead Capture with Single Sign On</p>
<h2>Source Code Location</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/oracle/sales-cloud-with-paas-samples">https://github.com/oracle/sales-cloud-with-paas-samples</a></li>
<li>Oracle Technology Network: <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/samplecode/solutions-architectures-samples-5012412.html">https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/samplecode/solutions-architectures-samples-5012412.html</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Oracle Cloud Products Involved</h2>
<ul>
<li>Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension</li>
<li>Oracle Sales Cloud</li>
<li>Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema)</li>
<li>Oracle JDeveloper Cloud specific version (11.1.1.7.1 or higher) / Oracle Enterprise pack for Eclipse available at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/downloads/index.html">this</a> location on OTN</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demonstrates</h2>
<p>This sample demonstrates the following aspects of Oracle Cloud integration:</p>
<h3>Primary Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>This sample demonstrates single-sign-on (SSO) from a Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension application linking out to Oracle Sales Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema) as the data store for the application deployed on Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Functional Overview</h2>
<p>Information and status pertaining to leads is kept in an ADF application deployed to Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension. External users of this system are given limited access to Oracle Sales Cloud leads and contacts for updating purposes. These users do not have access to other Oracle Sales Cloud system functions; what appears in menus and navigation is a slimmed-down subset of Oracle Sales Cloud features.</p>
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<p>The Java/ADF application is deployed to Java Cloud Service - Saas Extension and also uses Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema) to display additional data. A link to Oracle Sales Cloud is provided so a business user can quickly use the information displayed in the Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension application to work with Oracle Sales Cloud. Single Sign-On (SSO) is used to allow a user to access the Java Application without having to authenticate with Oracle Sales Cloud again, after being already authenticated with Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension.</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>All sample code is provided by Oracle for illustrative purposes only. The objective of this sample is only to demonstrate the goals defined above and may not represent other best practices, functional or technical. These sample code examples have not been thoroughly tested under all conditions. Oracle, therefore, cannot guarantee or imply security, reliability, serviceability, or function of the sample code.

<h2>User and Role Setup:</h2>
<h3>Setting up the Sample</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension and Oracle Sales Cloud instances should be associated. Refer to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/solutions&amp;id=GCSSL">Learn About Signing Up for an Oracle Cloud Subscription</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/solutions/call-java-cloud-soap-app-from-sales-cloud&amp;id=GUID-19C1D17A-195D-4CB3-AD04-0224F629165B">Learn About Authorization Strategies for Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension and Oracle SaaS Interactions</a> for more details.</li>
<li>For Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension, a user with the <em>Java Administrator</em> Role to deploy an application to the Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension instance is required. Refer to Chapter 7, &quot;Managing Users and Roles&quot; in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSGSG166">Getting Started with Oracle Cloud</a> for more details on creating users.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Running the Sample</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new user or use an existing user that exists in both Oracle Sales Cloud and Java Cloud Service-SaaS Extension. For Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension, refer to Chapter 7, &quot;Managing Users and Roles&quot; in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=CSGSG166">Getting Started with Oracle Cloud</a> for more details. For Sales Cloud, refer to Chapter 5, &quot;About Oracle Sales Cloud Users&quot; in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=OSCUS1288015">Securing Oracle Sales Cloud</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Sales Cloud user needs to be assigned a custom role. This role needs to be created in Sales Cloud. Refer to Chapter 12, &quot;Customizing Security&quot; in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=OSCUS1239294">Securing Oracle Sales Cloud</a> for details.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Install Instructions</h2>
<h3>Installation Steps</h3>
<p>Clone the Git repository locally. You can also download the code from OTN to your local working directory and follow the same steps below. However the remaining steps will assume that you are using git.</p>
<h3>Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema)</h3>
<p>Run the SQL scripts included in the source code using the SQL command in Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema).</p>
<p><em>git-home</em>/lead-capture-app-sso/DbCS/sql/crTable_LEAD_CAPTURE_SYS_SSO.sql</p>
<p>To confirm script execution, verify that the <code>LEAD_CAPTURE_SYS_SSO</code> table has been created in the Oracle Database Cloud Service (Database Schema) console.</p>
<h3>Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension</h3>
<p>Use JDeveloper to build the ADF application EAR and deploy it to Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the .jws in JDeveloper or Eclipse. Further steps in this readme will refer to JDeveloper although similar steps can be performed in Eclipse.</li>
<li>Change in the IE or with an editor the values for the token <em>@@datasource-servicename@@</em> in the file JCS-SX/ModelLeadCaptureSys/src/oracle/cloud/sampleaapps/leadcapturesys/model/common/bc4j.xcfg and for token <em>@@your_sales_cloud_URL@@</em> in file JCS-SX/ViewLCS/public_html/LeadCapture.jspx.</li>
<li>Deploy the application to your Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension instance. Refer to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/solutions/link-sales-cloud-from-java-cloud-saas&amp;id=GUID-8C5519F9-FB34-4D13-B313-BF0C7230A339">Deploy Applications Individually Using Oracle Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension Control</a> for more details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Create an application user for testing purposes.</p>
<h3>Oracle Sales Cloud</h3>
<p>Create a test user in Oracle Sales Cloud with the same user ID as the one created in Java Cloud Service - SaaS Extension.</p>
<ol>
<li>See Chapter 5, &quot;About Oracle Sales Cloud Users&quot;, in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&amp;id=OSCUS1288015">Securing Oracle Sales Cloud</a> for details.</li>
